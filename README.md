# My-Sample-portfolio



Initial Profile Card View

On opening my portfolio, visitors see a profile card containing my photo, name, college, and email.

Below the details is a “Show More Info” button.

Expanding the Details

When the “Show More Info” button is clicked, JavaScript dynamically expands the profile card to display a more detailed introduction about me.

This includes a short bio describing my skills, interests, and professional goals.

Bio Content

The expanded section shares information such as:

My passion for web development

My technical skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, modern frameworks)

My design approach and career aspirations

User Control

The button label changes to “Show Less Info”, allowing users to collapse the details back to the simple profile card view.

Purpose

This feature keeps the design minimal while allowing visitors to view more details only when they want to.

It improves user experience and keeps the layout clean.
