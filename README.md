3.Bio Content

 .The expanded section shares information such as:

 .My passion for web development

 .My technical skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, modern frameworks)

 .My design approach and career aspirations

4.User Control

 .The button label changes to “Show Less Info”, allowing users to collapse the details back to the simple profile card view.

5.Purpose

 .This feature keeps the design minimal while allowing visitors to view more details only when they want to.

 .It improves user experience and keeps the layout clean.
